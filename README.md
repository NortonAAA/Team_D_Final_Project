Team D Final Project for MSU Bootcamp

Overview of Project

Our team wanted to answer a very relevant question for many americans, including ourselves: Is there an increase in the cost of living for native Texans as a result of an influx of Californians moving there? We are confident we can answer this question. With that being said, below we will provide our process of aquiring the informaion, our databass, and our machine learning model(s).

Data
We decide to utilize the Postgres data base system. Our data will primialry be focused around the major 5 cities in America. The following is the list of major cities:

1. Chicago
2. Austin
3. Houston 
4. Nashville 
5. Charlottes

Based off our research we have come to the conclusion that these cities provide the most useful informaiton in anserwing our question. Our research revoles around investigating what is the average cost of living based off the ten years. We will also be analyzing housing prices.

Machine Learning 
After reviewing machine learning models, we believe that a "linear" model will benefit our project our project the most by giving us the most accurate output. The primary directive of our mode is to make a projection for 2-5 years out. We believe that it will be a sufficent time interval.
