# Team D: Rising Home Prices
## Overview of Project

Our team wanted to answer a very relevant question for many americans, including ourselves: **Is there an increase in the housing prices for our top five major cities** ? We are confident we can answer this question. With that being said, below we provided our process of aquiring the informaion, our database, and our machine learning model(s).

## Data 


We decide to utilize the Postgres data base system. Our data will primarily be focused on five major cities in America. The following is the list of major cities:

1. Chicago
2. Austin
3. Houston 
4. Nashville 
5. Charlotte

Based off our research we have come to the conclusion that these cities provide the most useful informaiton in answering our question. Our research revoles around investigating what is the **average cost of living** based off the ten years. We will also be analyzing the **housing prices** in the desired locations.

## Machine Learning 


After reviewing machine learning models, we believe that a **Supervised Linear Regression Model** will benefit our project the most by giving us the most accurate output. The primary directive of our model is to make a projection for 2-5 years out. We believe that it will be a sufficent time interval. **Our model should predict a linear trend**.
